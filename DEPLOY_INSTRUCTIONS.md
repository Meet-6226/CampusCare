# üöÄ Quick Deployment Instructions

## Problem Summary
Your Firebase Cloud Functions are **not deployed**, causing the notification system to fail with HTTP 500 errors.

## Solution: Deploy Cloud Functions

### Step 1: Open Terminal
Open Terminal app on your Mac.

### Step 2: Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd /Users/meetalshi/Downloads/Exam
```

### Step 3: Login to Firebase (if not already logged in)
```bash
firebase login
```
- This will open your browser
- Login with your Google account that has access to the Firebase project
- Return to Terminal after successful login

### Step 4: Set Firebase Project
```bash
firebase use exam-223d0
```
You should see: `Now using project exam-223d0`

### Step 5: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd functions
npm install
cd ..
```
Wait for installation to complete (1-2 minutes).

### Step 6: Deploy Cloud Functions
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

**This is the main step!** Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment.

You should see:
```
‚úî functions[sendNotification(us-central1)] Successful create operation.
‚úî functions[sendTargetedNotification(us-central1)] Successful create operation.
‚úî functions[getNotificationHistory(us-central1)] Successful create operation.
‚úî Deploy complete!
```

### Step 7: Test the Notification System
